## Connecting

This step is kinda optional, but I think it's a good idea, as it will ensure that the connection has been established/authorized.

It'll send a NIP-46 `connect` command to the nsecBunker; the nsecBunker will `ok` if/when the local private key is authorized to connect.

```typescript
await remoteSigner.blockUntilRead()
```
