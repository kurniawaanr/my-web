## Horizontal Pod Autoscaler {{ date: '2024-04-10T00:00Z' }}

the ideas to create Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU utilization with <b>Prometheus</b> and <b>Grafana</b> to continously monitoring cluster.
This project aims to fulfill final assignment, it might be a lot of misconception about everything and it might be not a best practice to do.
im still working and learn on this project to make it perfect.

## Continous Integration using Jenkins {{ date: '2024-04-15T00:00Z' }}

A local signer is an application key that is NOT tied to the user. The user might as well never see this key.

This _local_ key is the one that will be signing requests for nsecBunker to sign.

> A local key doesn't publish events for normal consumption, but rather, it solely exists to communicate with an nsecBunker.

## NodeJS REST API {{ date: '2024-04-30T00:00Z' }}

Lorem ipsum

### Generating a local signer

The following code will generate a new private key.

```typescript
const localSigner = NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate()
```

When creating a real integration, you would want to store this private key. Your users will be granting permissions to
this key, so you'll want to reuse this key across your user sessions when it makes sense to do so.

### Loading a local signer with a saved private key

If you have already saved a local key you would load it instead, obviously.

```typescript
const privateKey = localStorage.getItem('localSignerPrivateKey')
const localSigner = new NDKPrivateKeySigner(privateKey)
```

### Loading the remote signer

The remote signer is a `NDKNip46Signer`, which communicates with the nsecBunker (over nostr relays, obviously) to exchange event signatures and other things.

### Target pubkey

The next and final thing we'll need is the remote pubkey we desired to sign as. We'll ask the user in some way
what's the pubkey they want to sign as.

```typescript
const desiredPubkeyOrToken = prompt(`Enter your npub or token`)
```

### Token

What's that token thing? Is it a shitcoin? Nah.

A token is a one-time-use secret that users can configure in their nsecBunker to confer a set of permissions
to an application. For example, a user might give your application permission to only sign kind:1 events, but not
kind:0 events.

It looks like: `npub#secret`.

### Communicating with the nsecBunker

Since the remote signer is accessed via Nostr, we use an `NDK` instance to communicate with it.

Now, you can either use the same NDK instance you use for all other nostr communications but, for now, I choose to create a dedicated NDK instance that will just be used to communicate with the nsecBunker.

```typescript
const bunkerNDK = new NDK({
  explicitRelayUrls: ['wss://relay.nsecbunker.com', 'wss://nostr.vulpem.com'],
})
bunkerNDK.connect(2000)

const remoteSigner = new NDKNip46Signer(
  bunkerNDK,
  desiredPubkeyOrToken,
  localSigner
)
```

Now that we have both our signers, let's create the generic NDK instance we're going to be using to
communicate for normal nostr usage.

```typescript
const typicalNDK = new NDK({
  explicitRelayUrls: [
    'wss://relay.damus.io',
    'wss://nos.lol',
    // ...
  ],
  signer: remoteSigner,
})
```

We're going to pass in to this NDK instance the remote signer.

## Connecting

This step is kinda optional, but I think it's a good idea, as it will ensure that the connection has been established/authorized.

It'll send a NIP-46 `connect` command to the nsecBunker; the nsecBunker will `ok` if/when the local private key is authorized to connect.

```typescript
await remoteSigner.blockUntilRead()
```
